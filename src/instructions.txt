Your goal is to reach the safe zone (Green Square) while avoiding the ghosts. The ability to finish the map is only unlocked when all Maps are collected. A Sword will sometimes spawn for you in a random area. This will grant you the ability to survive one ghost and eliminate it from the current map.

Be warned, the enemies in this game have the ability to mimick your every action! Use this knowledge to your advantage as you encounter one in your path.

Goodluck.
